# Ukraine Alerts

Air Raid Alerts (Ukraine)

This integration for Home Assistant is built on the API <https://alerts.com.ua/>
The integration is designed to notify users about air alerts. With our integration you can configure automations that can trigger sirens in Home Assistant or run other scenarios.
To get API keys, you need to email API authors for API keys at  [a@dun.ai](mailto:a@dun.ai) or on Telegram [@andunai](https://t.me/andunai).

Setting up the integration is extremely simple. In the integration settings dialog box you need to enter the API key and select the region you live in, and the system will automatically start tracking air alerts in your region
